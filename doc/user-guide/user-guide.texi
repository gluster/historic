@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

GlusterFS is a distributed filesystem. It works at the file level,
not block level.

A network filesystem is one which allows us to access remote files. A
distributed filesystem is one that stores data on multiple machines
and makes them all appear to be a part of the same filesystem.

Need for distributed filesystems

@itemize @bullet
@item Scalability: A distributed filesystem allows us to store more data than what can be stored on a single machine.

@item Redundancy: We might want to replicate crucial data on to several machines.

@item Uniform access: One can mount a remote volume (for example your home directory) from any machine and access the same data.
@end itemize

@node Pre requisites
@section Pre requisites

Before installing GlusterFS make sure you have the
following components installed.

@subsection @acronym{FUSE}
You'll need @acronym{FUSE} version 2.6.0 or higher to
use GlusterFS. You can omit installing @acronym{FUSE} if you want to
build @emph{only} the server. Note that you won't be able to mount
a GlusterFS filesystem on a machine that does not have @acronym{FUSE}
installed.

@acronym{FUSE} can be downloaded from: @indicateurl{http://fuse.sourceforge.net/}

@subsection libibverbs (optional)
@cindex InfiniBand, installation
@cindex libibverbs
This is only needed if you want GlusterFS to use InfiniBand as the
interconnect mechanism between server and client. You can get it from:

@indicateurl{http://www.openfabrics.org/downloads.htm}.

@subsection Bison and Flex
These should be already installed on most Linux systems. We recommend
using @acronym{GNU} Bison and Flex.

@node Getting GlusterFS
@section Getting GlusterFS
@cindex Arch
There are many ways to get hold of GlusterFS. For a production deployment,
the recommended method is to download the latest release tarball.
Release tarballs are available at: @indicateurl{http://gluster.org/download.php}.

If you want the bleeding edge development source, you can get them
from the @acronym{GNU}
Arch@footnote{@indicateurl{http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/}}
repository. First you must install @acronym{GNU} Arch itself. Then
register the GlusterFS archive by doing:

@example
$ tla register-archive http://arch.sv.gnu.org/archives/gluster
@end example

Now you can check out the source itself:

@example
$ tla get -A gluster@@sv.gnu.org glusterfs--mainline--2.5
@end example

@cindex @acronym{RPM} package
If you are on an @acronym{RPM} based system, you can also try @acronym{RPM}s
contributed by Matthew Paine (@email{matt@@mattsoftware.com}), for CentOS 5,
available at: 

@indicateurl{http://www.mattsoftware.com/msw_repo/centos/5/}

@cindex Ubuntu package
Leonardo Rodrigues de Mello (@email{l@@lmello.eu.org}) has created Ubuntu
(Etch) packages of GlusterFS. They are available at:

@indicateurl{http://guialivre.governoeletronico.gov.br/guiaonline/downloads/pacotes-cluster/dists/etch/glusterfs/}

@node Building
@section Building
You can skip this section if you're installing from @acronym{RPM}s
or @acronym{DEB}s.

GlusterFS uses the Autotools mechanism to build. As such, the procedure
is straight-forward. First, change into the GlusterFS source directory.

@example
$ cd glusterfs--1.3
@end example

If you checked out the source from the Arch repository, you'll need
to run @command{./autogen.sh} first. Note that you'll need to have
Autoconf and Automake installed for this. 

Run @command{configure}.

@example
$ ./configure
@end example

The configure script accepts the following options:

@table @code

@item --disable-ibverbs
Disable the InfiniBand transport mechanism.

@item --disable-fuse-client
Disable the @acronym{FUSE} client.

@item --disable-server
Disable building of the GlusterFS server.

@node A Tutorial Introduction
@section A Tutorial Introduction

This section will show you how to quickly get GlusterFS up and running. We'll 
configure GlusterFS as a simple network filesystem, with one server and one client.
In this mode of usage, GlusterFS can serve as a replacement for NFS.

We'll make use of two machines; call them @emph{server} and
@emph{client} (If you don't want to setup two machines, just run
everything that follows on the same machine).  In the examples that
follow, the shell prompts will use these names to clarify the machine
on which the command is being run. For example, a command that should
be run on the server will be shown with the prompt:

@example
[root@@server]#
@end example

Our goal is to make a directory on the @emph{server} (say, @command{/export})
accessible to the @emph{client}.

First of all, get GlusterFS installed on both the machines, as described in the 
previous sections. Make sure you have the @acronym{FUSE} kernel module loaded. You
can ensure this by running: 

@example
[root@@server]# modprobe fuse
@end example

Before we can run the GlusterFS client or server programs, we need to write
two files called @emph{volume specifications}. The volume spec describes the 
@emph{translator tree} on a node. The next chapter will explain the concepts of
`translator' and `volume specification' in detail. For now, just assume that
the volume spec is like an NFS @command{/etc/export} file.

On the server, create a text file somewhere (we'll assume the path
@command{/tmp/glusterfs-server.vol}) with the following contents.

@cartouche
@example
volume colon-o
  type storage/posix
  option directory /export
end-volume

volume server
  type protocol/server
  subvolumes colon-o
  option transport-type tcp/server     
  option auth.ip.colon-o.allow *
end-volume
@end example
@end cartouche

A brief explanation of the file's contents. The first section defines a storage
volume, named ``colon-o'' (the volume names are arbitrary), which exports the
@command{/export} directory. The second section defines options for the translator
which will make the storage volume accessible remotely. It specifies @command{colon-o} as
a subvolume. This defines the @emph{translator tree}, about which more will be said
in the next chapter. The two options specify that the @acronym{TCP} protocol is to be
used (as opposed to InfiniBand, for example), and that access to the storage volume
is to be provided to clients with any @acronym{IP} address at all. If you wanted to
restrict access to this server to only your subnet for example, you'd specify
something like @command{192.168.1.*} in the second option line.

On the client machine, create the following text file (again, we'll assume
the path to be @command{/tmp/glusterfs-client.vol}). Replace
@emph{server-ip-address} with the @acronym{IP} address of your server machine. If you
are doing all this on a single machine, use @command{127.0.0.1}.

@cartouche
@example
volume client
  type protocol/client
  option transport-type tcp/client
  option remote-host @emph{server-ip-address}
  option remote-subvolume colon-o
end-volume
@end example
@end cartouche

Now we need to start both the server and client programs. To start the server:

@example
[root@@server]# glusterfsd -f /tmp/glusterfs-server.vol
@end example

To start the client:

@example
[root@@client]# glusterfs -f /tmp/glusterfs-client.vol /mnt/glusterfs
@end example

You should now be able to see the files under the server's @command{/export} directory
in the @command{/mnt/glusterfs} directory on the client. That's it, GlusterFS is now
working as a network file system.

@section Filesystems in Userspace

@image{fuse}
@center Fig 1. Control flow in GlusterFS

A filesystem is usually implemented in the kernel. Kernel development is much
harder than userspace development. @acronym{FUSE} is a kernel module/library 
that allows us to write a filesystem completely in userspace.

@acronym{FUSE} consists of a kernel module which interacts with the userspace
implementation using a device file @code{/dev/fuse}. When a process 
makes a syscall on a @acronym{FUSE} filesystem, @acronym{VFS} hands the request to the
@acronym{FUSE} module, which writes the request to @code{/dev/fuse}. The
userspace implementation polls @code{/dev/fuse}, and when a request arrives,
processes it and writes the result back to @code{/dev/fuse}. The kernel then
reads from the device file and returns the result to the user process.

 -> server -> underlying filesystem

@node Storage Translators
@section Storage Translators

The storage translators form the ``backend'' for GlusterFS. Currently,
the only available storage translator is the @acronym{POSIX}
translator, which stores files on a normal @acronym{POSIX}
filesystem. A pleasant consequence of this is that your data will
still be accessible if GlusterFS crashes or cannot be started.

Other storage backends are planned for the future. One of the possibilities is an
Amazon S3 translator. Amazon S3 is an unlimited online storage service accessible
through a web services @acronym{API}. The S3 translator will allow you to access
the storage as a normal @acronym{POSIX} filesystem.

The @command{posix} translator uses a normal @acronym{POSIX}
filesystem as its ``backend'' to actually store files and
directories. This can be any filesystem that supports extended
attributes (@acronym{EXT3}, ReiserFS, @acronym{XFS}, ...). Extended
attributes are used by some translators to store metadata (for
example, by the @acronym{AFR} and stripe translators. See sections
4.3.2 and 4.3.3, respectively).

@subsection Transport modules
The client and server translators are capable of using any of the
pluggable transport modules. Currently available transport modules are
@command{tcp}, which uses a @acronym{TCP} connection between client
and server to communicate; @command{ib-sdp}, which uses a
@acronym{TCP} connection over InfiniBand, and @command{ibverbs}, which
uses high-speed InfiniBand connections.

@node IB-SDP
@subsubsection IB-SDP
kernel implements socket interface for ib hardware. SDP is over ib-verbs.
This module accepts the same options as @command{tcp}

@node ibverbs
@subsubsection ibverbs

@cindex InfiniBand transport

The @command{ib-verbs} transport accesses the InfiniBand hardware through
the ``verbs'' @acronym{API}, which is the lowest level of software access possible
and which gives the highest performance. On InfiniBand hardware, it is always
best to use @command{ib-verbs}. Use @command{ib-sdp} only if you cannot get
@command{ib-verbs} working for some reason. 

If you are familiar with InfiniBand jargon,
the mode is used by GlusterFS is ``reliable connection-oriented channel transfer''.

(Mellanox notes).

The @command{ib-verbs} transport module accepts the following options.

@table @code
@item ib-verbs-work-request-send-count <n> (64)
Length of the send queue in datagrams. [Reason to increase/decrease?]

@item ib-verbs-work-request-recv-count <n> (64)
Length of the receive queue in datagrams. [Reason to increase/decrease?]

@item ib-verbs-work-request-send-size <size> (128KB)
Size of each datagram that is sent. [Reason to increase/decrease?]

@item ib-verbs-work-request-recv-size <size> (128KB)
Size of each datagram that is received. [Reason to increase/decrease?]

@item ib-verbs-port <n> (1)
Port number for ib-verbs.

@item ib-verbs-mtu [256|512|1024|2048|4096] (2048)
The Maximum Transmission Unit [Reason to increase/decrease?]

@item ib-verbs-device-name <device-name> (first device in the list)
InfiniBand device to be used.
@end table

For maximum performance, you should ensure that the send/receive counts on both
the client and server are the same.

ib-verbs is preferred over ib-sdp.

unify unifies its subvolumes.

scheduler is used for creates. 
 rr, random
 nufa - prefers local. otherwise does rr
 alu - adaptive least usage. Various criteria. order of preference. entry & exit
       threshold.

@subsubsection ALU

ALU stands for "Adaptive Least Usage". It is the most advanced
scheduler available in GlusterFS. It balances the load across volumes,
taking several factors in account. It adapts itself to changing I/O
patterns, according to its configuration. When properly configured, it
can eliminate the need for regular tuning of the filesystem to keep
volume load nicely balanced.

The ALU scheduler is composed of multiple least-usage
sub-schedulers. Each sub-scheduler keeps track of a certain type of
load, for each of the subvolumes, getting the actual statistics from
the subvolumes themselves. The sub-schedulers are these:

disk-usage - the used and free disk space on the volume

read-usage - the amount of reading done from this volume

write-usage - the amount of writing done to this volume

open-files-usage - the number of files currently opened from this volume

disk-speed-usage - the speed at which the disks are spinning. This is
a constant value and therefore not very useful.

The ALU scheduler needs to know which of these sub-schedulers to use,
and in which order to evaluate them. This is done through the 
@command{option alu.order} configuration directive.

Each sub-scheduler needs to know two things: when to kick in (the
entry-threshold), and how long to stay in control (the
exit-threshold). For example: when unifying three disks of 100GB,
keeping an exact balance of disk-usage is not necesary. Instead, there
could be a 1GB margin, which can be used to nicely balance other
factors, such as read-usage. The disk-usage scheduler can be told to
kick in only when a certain threshold of discrepancy is passed, such
as 1GB. When it assumes control under this condition, it will write
all subsequent data to the least-used volume. If it is doing so, it is
unwise to stop right after the values are below the entry-threshold
again, since that would make it very likely that the situation will
occur again very soon. Such a situation would cause the ALU to spend
most of its time disk-usage scheduling, which is unfair to the other
sub-schedulers. The exit-threshold therefore defines the amount of
data that needs to be written to the least-used disk, before control
is relinquished again.

In addition to the sub-schedulers, the ALU scheduler also has "limits"
options. These can stop the creation of new files on a volume once
values drop below a certain threshold. For example, setting "option
alu.limits.min-free-disk 5GB" will stop the scheduling of files to
volumes that have less than 5GB of free disk space, leaving the files
on that disk some room to grow.

The actual values you assign to the thresholds for sub-schedulers and
limits depend on your situation. If you have fast-growing files,
you'll want to stop file-creation on a disk much earlier than when
hardly any of your files are growing. If you care less about
disk-usage balance than about read-usage balance, you'll want a bigger
disk-usage scheduler entry-threshold and a smaller read-usage
scheduler entry-threshold.

For thresholds defining a size, values specifying "KB", "MB" and "GB"
are allowed. For example: @command{option alu.limits.min-free-disk 5GB}.

@table @code
@item alu.order <order> * ("disk-usage:write-usage:read-usage:open-files-usage:disk-speed")
@item alu.disk-usage.entry-threshold <size> (1GB)
@item alu.disk-usage.exit-threshold <size> (512MB)
@item alu.write-usage.entry-threshold <%> (25)
@item alu.write-usage.exit-threshold <%> (5)

@item alu.open-files-usage.exit-threshold <n> (100)
@item alu.limits.min-free-disk <%> 
@item alu.limits.max-open-files <n> 
@end table

@subsubsection Round Robin (RR)

Round-Robin (RR) scheduler creates files in a round-robin
fashion. Each client will have its own round-robin loop. When your
files are mostly similar in size and I/O access pattern, this
scheduler is a good choice. RR scheduler now checks for free disk size
of the server before scheduling, so you can know when to add
another server brick. The default value of min-free-disk is 5% and is
checked every 10 seconds (by default) if there is any create call
happening.

@table @code
@item rr.limits.min-free-disk <%> (5)
@item rr.refresh-interval <t> (10 seconds)
@end table

@table @code
@item random.limits.min-free-disk <%> (5)
@item random.refresh-interval <t> (10 seconds)
@end table

@subsubsection NUFA

Non-Uniform Filesystem Scheduler similar to NUMA
@footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Uniform_Memory_Access}
memory design. It is mainly used in HPC environments where you are
required to run the filesystem server and client within the same
cluster. Under such environment, NUFA scheduler gives the local system
first priority for file creation over other nodes.

heal functionality. Version number and ctime is stored in the attributes.

All of this not recommended:
If you increase n, new file will be created.
If you decrease n, nothing happens.

If you change subvolume order, it asserts that the first n *available* (nodes
which are up) subvolumes have the file.

If a file is missing on a node, the latest version available will
be written there. Missing directories are created during lookup.

@node Read Ahead
@subsection Read Ahead
@cindex read ahead (translator)
@example
type performance/read-ahead
@end example

read-ahead pre-fetches a sequence of blocks in advance based on its
predictions. When your application is busy crunching the data it has
read, glusterfs can pre-read the next batch of data in advance and
keep it ready. That way consecutive reads are faster. Additionally it
also behaves as a read-aggregator, i.e smaller I/O read operations are
combined into fewer larger read operations internally to reduce
network and disk load. page-size describes the block size and
page-count describes amount of blocks to pre-fetch.

This translator is well utilized when used with IB-verbs
transport. With FastEthernet and GigE interface, without read-ahead,
one can achieve link max.

all reads are broken into page counts. page+n are read. if the read is not 
consecutive read ahead is stopped.
page-count is per file.

@node Write Behind
@subsection Write Behind
@cindex write behind (translator)
@example
type performance/write-behind
@end example

In general write operations are slower than read. The write-behind
translator improves write performance significantly over read by using
"aggregated background write" technique. That is, multiple smaller
write operations are aggregated into fewer larger write operations and
written in background (non-blocking). aggregate-size determines the
block size till which write data should be aggregated. Depending upon
your interconnect, RAM size and work load profile you should tune this
value. Default of 128KB works well for most users. Increasing or
decreasing this value beyond certain range will bring down your
performance. You should always benchmark with an increasing range of
aggregate-size and analyze the results to choose an optimum value.

@node IO Threads
@subsection IO Threads
@cindex io threads (translator)
@example
type performance/io-threads
@end example

AIO add asynchronous (background) read and write functionality. By
loading this translator, you can utilize the server idle blocked time
to handle new incoming requests. CPU, memory or network is not
utilized when the server is blocked on read or write call while
DMA'ing disk. This translator makes best use of all the resources
under load and improves concurrent I/O performance.

NOTE: io-threads translator is useful when used over unify, or just
below server protocol in server side. Its not used at all if used
between unify and namespace brick as there is no FileI/O over
namespace brick.

cache size = maximum that can be pending inside a thread.

@node IO Cache
@subsection IO Cache
@cindex io cache (translator)
@example
type performance/io-cache
@end example

IO-Cache translator helps one to reduce to load on server (if loaded
on client side) if client is accessing some files just for reading
(and the file is not edited in server actually between two reads). For
example, the header files are accessed for compilation of kernel.

@node POSIX Locks
@subsection POSIX Locks
@cindex locking
@cindex fcntl
@cindex @acronym{POSIX} locks (translator)
@example
type features/posix-locks
@end example

This translator provides storage independent POSIX record locking
support (fcntl locking). Typically you'll want to load this on the
server side, just above the @acronym{POSIX} storage translator. Using this
translator you can get both advisory locking and mandatory locking
support.  flock not supported.

Caveat: Consider a file that does not have its mandatory locking bits
(+setgid, -group execution) turned on. Assume that this file is now
opened by a process on a client that has the write-behind xlator
loaded. The write-behind xlator does not cache anything for files
which have mandatory locking enabled, to avoid incoherence. Let's say
that mandatory locking is now enabled on this file through another
client. The former client will not know about this change, and
write-behind may erroneously report a write as being successful when
in fact it would fail due to the region it is writing to being locked.

There seems to be no easy way to fix this. To work around this
problem, it is recommended that you never enable the mandatory bits on
a file while it is open.
